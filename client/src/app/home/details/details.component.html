          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>The application consist of a three elements: <strong>angular</strong> client, <strong>.net core</strong> backend and contract on the <strong>blockchain</strong>. The utilization of .net backend and blockchain was introduced to compare those <strong>two technologies which are not connected in project between themselfs</strong> and lives separately. There is a solution to introduce it, and i already think about it, and it could be relatively easy, but time-consuming, and the final development would not have a big impact on the visible effect for the user, which was important to me.</p>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>When going to the <strong>shop tab</strong>, products from the database are displayed, in the <strong>crypto tab</strong> products from the blockchain contract are visible. The product displays the <strong>name, price</strong> and two buttons, one to <strong>buy</strong>, the other to open the <strong>product details</strong>.</p>
          <p>Both stores use the <strong>same models and components</strong>. Products can be found by <strong>filtering</strong> and <strong>sorting</strong>, and <strong>searching</strong> by name or part of the description. The whole thing is wrapped in a <strong>pagination</strong> component, and the products for each page are downloaded every time the page is changed.</p>

              Authentication
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>There are two modules in the application with <strong>guarded access</strong> by non-logged in users: the <strong>product purchase module</strong> and the <strong>order module</strong>. We can add the products with no logging to the basket but when we try to purchase a product and not being logged in, we will be redirected to the <strong>login page</strong> with the possibility of <strong>registration</strong>.</p>
          <p>As an authentication module the <strong>UserManager</strong> was used. This is a class derived from <strong>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity</strong> and have all the necessary methods for logging in and registering as well as storing <strong>users in a separate database</strong>.</p>

          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>After completing the login process, the user has the option to <strong>add the product to the basket</strong>. By performing this action, the number of independent items displayed next to the cart <strong>icon will be updated</strong>. Product information will be <strong>cached using 'redis'</strong> technology for fast, reliable and scalable memory access.</p>

          <p>After completing the adding process, you can go to <strong>purchase products</strong> by clicking 'Proceed to checkout' in the basket, where you provide information about the <strong>shipping address</strong> and <strong>delivery method</strong>. The next step is <strong>order review</strong> and <strong>payment</strong>. The <strong>'stripe'</strong> library was used for payment, its implementation is described in the next chapter.</p>

              Step 1
            </mat-panel-title>
            <mat-panel-description>
              Payment intent
            </mat-panel-description>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>When the customer proceeds to the payment, a <strong>PaymentIntent</strong> is created with the current amount to be paid and the payment currency in <strong>PLN</strong>. If the customer leaves the payment process, the PaymentIntent will be <strong>refreshed when he re-enters</strong> and the <strong>amount will be recalculated</strong>, taking into account possible changes in the basket.</p>
        </mat-expansion-panel>

        <mat-expansion-panel>

            <mat-panel-description>
              Payment secret
            </mat-panel-description>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>After creating a PaymentIntent, the customer receives a <strong>secret</strong> thanks to which he will be able to <strong>complete the payment</strong>. The secret is stored in the <strong>basket model</strong> and does not change when updating the amount when re-entering the payment process.</p>
        </mat-expansion-panel>

        <mat-expansion-panel>
          <mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <mat-panel-title>
              Step 3
            </mat-panel-title>
            <mat-panel-description>
              Payment method and creation of an order
            </mat-panel-description>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>The last step is to choose a <strong>payment method</strong> and pay for the products. The <strong>'payment element'</strong> from the stripe library was used to <strong>handle payments</strong>, which allows you to automatically <strong>display the available payment methods</strong>, for the PLN currency these are: <strong>debit or credit card</strong>, <strong>przelewy 24</strong>, <strong>blik</strong> and <strong>google pay</strong>. The available options can be configured by logging in with your own account at <strong>https://stripe.com</strong>. An additional simplification of the process can be the use of the <strong>'link'</strong> method that can <strong>remember the details of the card</strong> and the next time you try to pay, the data will not be required anymore and you will be able to pay by entering only a <strong>six-digit pin</strong></p>
          <p>After selecting the method and during the payment process, an <strong>order is created</strong> in the pending status, and immediately after that the <strong>payment process begins</strong></p>

        <mat-expansion-panel>
          <mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <mat-panel-title>
              Step 4
            </mat-panel-title>
            <mat-panel-description>
              Payment finalization and webhook listener
            </mat-panel-description>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>The payment is made by calling the <strong>'confirmPayment'</strong> method from the stripe library, where additional parameters are provided, such as: <strong>return_url</strong>, <strong>billing_details</strong>, <strong>redirect</strong>, the first one allows you to <strong>redirect</strong> the page to the <strong>specified address</strong> after the payment is completed, it is most useful when redirecting the payment to an <strong>external website</strong>, which is required for some methods eg <strong>'google pay'</strong>. The <strong>billing details</strong> can include information such as the customer's <strong>name</strong> or <strong>e-mail address</strong>, it is an optional value and will be displayed in the <strong>payment panel</strong> at https://stripe.com, the last parameter allows you to specify whether the <strong>redirection should always occur</strong> or only in when it is required.</p>
          <p>Redirecting to another address after payment is associated with some difficulties on the site, <strong>the code that should run after payment can no longer be executed</strong>, so in the case of redirection after payment, the basket will not be cleaned. This is a case that had to be <strong>handled separately</strong> by querying stripe for the current payment status using the <strong>'retrievePaymentIntent'</strong> function.</p>
          <p>After confirming the payment, the <strong>basket is removed</strong> and the page with the <strong>payment success opens</strong>, as well as a button to go to the order, where you can track its status. There is a <strong>webhook</strong> for updating the <strong>order status</strong>, i.e. an api method created to listen to requests sent to it. Proper reading of the event and security of the api is ensured by the <strong>'Stripe-Signature'</strong> sent in the request header, reading this value and using the secret known to the server, you can properly read the event. Webook listens for two events: <strong>payment_intent.succeeded</strong> and <strong>payment_intent.payment_failed</strong>, after receiving one of them, the order status is updated accordingly.</p>
